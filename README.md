## JavaFX: UISamples
This is a very simple and straight-forward implementation of solutions based on JavaFX Framework.

### Disclaimer

This repository contains a sample code intended to demonstrate the capabilities of JavaFX, solving small issues or implementing basic features. The current version is not intended to be used as-is in applications as a library dependency, and will not be maintained as such. Bug fix contributions are welcome, but issues and feature requests will not be addressed.

### Pre-requisites

- Java 8
- JavaFX
- Maven 3

## Credits

This project was based on these libraries:

- [Java WebSockets][1] for the WebSockets implementation
- [JmDNS library][2] for the Service discovery.
- [SystemTray][3] for the SystemTray implementation.
- [JavaFxSVG][4] for adding SVG support to JavaFX
- [Apache Commons Math][5] for addressing the most common practical problems not immediately available in the Java programming language or commons-lang. 
- [jackson-databind][6] for general data-binding package for Jackson.
